              , Associate Professor in the Department of Computer Science and
              Engineering and Head of the Mechatronics program at IIT Bhilai.
              specializing in Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning
              (ML), and industrial systems engineering. I hold a B.Tech in
              Computer Science and Engineering, with a strong background in AI,
              video analysis, and backend engineering. At IIT Bhilai, I have led
              the development of an AI-powered alert system for pre-failure
              detection in rolling mills, focusing on BSP. This system
              integrates alarm segmentation, correlation, feedback integration,
              and predictive video analysis to prevent failures. My expertise
              extends to PCA-based model training, time-series analysis, anomaly
              detection, and object detection using OpenCV. I also write custom
              logic to analyze alerts, track correlations, and develop
              preventive strategies. The core tech stack includes Python, Flask,
              Grafana, InfluxDB, and various backend tools, combining real-time
              video streams and data analysis to enhance operational safety. I
              am passionate about applying AI/ML to solve real-world industrial
              challenges, particularly in predictive maintenance and intelligent
              monitoring systems. ðŸš€ Letâ€™s connect and build smarter, safer
              infrastructures together!

                ðŸš€ I am actively open to applied Machine Learning research roles
